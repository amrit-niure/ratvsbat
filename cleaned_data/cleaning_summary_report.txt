CLEANING OPERATIONS PERFORMED:
  1. Datetime conversion and validation
  2. Missing value imputation
  3. Categorical data standardization
  4. Outlier detection and flagging
  5. Feature engineering (time-based, interactions)
  6. Data validation and range checking
  7. Binary encoding for machine learning readiness

RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS:
  1. Exploratory data analysis
  2. Statistical testing for rat vs no-rat conditions
